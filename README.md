# HungerGames
A desktop app that created with python and sqlite3

- This is a desktop app that created as a school project. This app contains a database with the data based on hunger games.
- You can enter the program as 3 different types. Game maker, sponsor or mentor.
- Main idea is that these 3 different types of users will enter the program and help out the players.
- Game makers can give awards to the mentors or record a interaction between players or add a rule to their existing game.
- Sponsors can find the players(by filtering) and send them a gift to help them in their game. They also can change their credit card if they ran out of money.
- Mentors can see their mentoring player. They can see what this player did recently and also which sponsor send a gift to them. 
- Also mentors need to authorize the gifts of their players to let them use it. Therefore, they can see the pending gifts for their players.


- The purpose of this project is to create a complex database system.
- The GUI part is fully integrated with the database and working with it.
- You can download and inspect the database.
- Python GUI part is not the main aspect of the project, so, It's not very user friendly. Excuse me about it!

Enjoy!
